## Usage Notes and Constraints

* ✅ Field `32a` must use Option A if the sender has credited the receiver in advance, otherwise use Option B.
* ✅ Field `75` allows narrative queries with numbered prefixes and optional extra lines.
* ⚠️ If MT110 was previously sent for the same cheque, field values such as `21`, `30`, `32a`, and `59` must match.
* ⚠️ `59` must not contain an account number — only name and address allowed.
