## Conditional Rules

* **C1**: The repeating sequence of fields 23/25/30/37H must occur at least once and at most 10 times.
* **C2**: Either `23` or `25` must be present, but not both in the same sequence.

## Field-Specific Notes

* `23` Function codes: BASE, CALL, COMMERCIAL, CURRENT, DEPOSIT, NOTICE, PRIME
* `23` Number of Days is used **only** with Function = NOTICE (e.g., `USD07NOTICE`)
* `37H` Indicator: `C` = Credit Rate, `D` = Debit Rate
* `37H` must not include sign if rate is zero
* `72` supports `/code/` + `//narrative` formats for bilateral use
