/// # Field 23B: Bank Operation Code
///
/// ## Overview
/// Field 23B specifies the type of operation being performed in the SWIFT MT message.
/// This field is mandatory in most MT messages and determines how the financial institution
/// should process the transaction. The operation code influences routing, processing rules,
/// and regulatory reporting requirements.
///
/// ## Format Specification
/// **Format**: `4!c`
/// - **4!c**: Exactly 4 alphabetic characters
/// - **Character set**: A-Z (uppercase letters only)
/// - **Case handling**: Automatically converted to uppercase
/// - **Validation**: Must be exactly 4 characters, all alphabetic
///
/// ## Standard Operation Codes
/// The most commonly used operation codes in SWIFT MT messages:
///
/// ### Primary Codes
/// - **CRED**: Credit Transfer - Standard customer credit transfer
/// - **CRTS**: Credit Transfer Same Day - Same day credit transfer
/// - **SPAY**: Supplementary Payment - Additional payment information
/// - **SSTD**: Standing Order - Recurring payment instruction
///
/// ### Extended Codes (Institution-specific)
/// - **SPRI**: Special Priority - High priority processing
/// - **URGP**: Urgent Payment - Expedited processing required
/// - **RTGS**: Real Time Gross Settlement - RTGS system processing
/// - **NETS**: Net Settlement - Net settlement processing
///
/// ## Usage Context
/// Field 23B is used in numerous SWIFT MT message types:
/// - **MT103**: Single Customer Credit Transfer
/// - **MT202**: General Financial Institution Transfer
/// - **MT202COV**: Cover for customer credit transfer
/// - **MT205**: Financial Institution Transfer for its Own Account
/// - **MT210**: Notice to Receive
///
/// ### Business Applications
/// - **Payment routing**: Determines processing path and priority
/// - **STP processing**: Enables straight-through processing rules
/// - **Regulatory compliance**: Affects reporting and monitoring
/// - **Fee calculation**: May influence pricing and charges
/// - **Risk management**: Impacts fraud detection and AML screening
/// - **Settlement timing**: Affects when funds are made available
///
/// ## Processing Rules
/// Different operation codes trigger specific processing behaviors:
///
/// ### CRED (Credit Transfer)
/// - Standard processing timeline
/// - Normal priority in payment queues
/// - Standard regulatory reporting
/// - Typical settlement timing
///
/// ### CRTS (Credit Transfer Same Day)
/// - Expedited processing required
/// - Higher priority in payment queues
/// - Same-day settlement mandate
/// - Enhanced monitoring and tracking
///
/// ### SPAY (Supplementary Payment)
/// - Additional payment details provided
/// - May require manual review
/// - Enhanced compliance checking
/// - Detailed audit trail required
///
/// ### SSTD (Standing Order)
/// - Recurring payment processing
/// - Template-based validation
/// - Automated scheduling
/// - Long-term relationship tracking
///
/// ## Validation Rules
/// 1. **Length**: Must be exactly 4 characters
/// 2. **Character set**: Only alphabetic characters (A-Z)
/// 3. **Case**: Automatically normalized to uppercase
/// 4. **Standards compliance**: Should use recognized codes
/// 5. **Business rules**: Must align with message type and context
///
/// ## Network Validated Rules (SWIFT Standards)
/// - Operation code must be exactly 4 alphabetic characters (Error: T26)
/// - Must contain only valid SWIFT character set (Error: T61)
/// - Should be a recognized operation code (Warning: recommended practice)
/// - Must be consistent with message type (Error: T40)
///
///
/// ## Examples
/// ```text
/// :23B:CRED
/// └─── Standard credit transfer
///
/// :23B:CRTS
/// └─── Same day credit transfer
///
/// :23B:SPAY
/// └─── Supplementary payment
///
/// :23B:SSTD
/// └─── Standing order payment
/// ```
